        "#Workflow Breakdown Brief\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Setting Up:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*  **Libraries:** The script imports necessary libraries like `pandas` for data manipulation, `requests` for downloading videos, `cv2` for computer vision tasks, `face_recognition` for face detection and encoding, `json` for handling JSON data, and `numpy` for numerical computations.\n",
        "*  **Known Encodings:** It defines file paths for saving known face encodings in a JSON format (`encoding_file`). It also includes functions to save and load these encodings (`save_encodings_json` and `load_encodings_json`).\n",
        "*  **Downloading Videos:** The `download_video` function retrieves videos from URLs specified in the excel file.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Processing Videos:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*  **Read Excel Data:** The script reads an excel file (`excel_file`), assuming it has columns like \"Video URL\" and \"Performance\" (potentially for further analysis).\n",
        "*  **Iterate Through Videos:** It loops through each row in the DataFrame.\n",
        "  * **Download and Open Video:** For each video URL, it downloads the video and opens a video capture object (`cap`) using OpenCV's `cv2.VideoCapture`.\n",
        "  * **Initialize Counters:** It initializes counters for unique faces detected in the entire process (`unique_faces_count`) and new faces detected in the current video (`new_faces_count`). It also creates an empty list (`faces_in_video`) to store detected faces for the current video and a set (`current_video_faces`) to track unique faces within the video.\n",
        "  * **Process Video Frames:** It enters a loop that reads video frames one by one using `cap.read()`.\n",
        "    * **Check for Success:** It checks if the frame is read successfully. If not, it handles the error and breaks the loop if the video ends, or continues if there's a reading issue.\n",
        "    * **Resize and Convert Frame:** It resizes and converts the frame to RGB format for face recognition.\n",
        "    * **Face Detection:** The core face detection part uses `face_recognition.face_locations` to identify face locations within the frame using a pre-trained CNN model (\"cnn\").\n",
        "    * **No Faces Detected:** If no faces are found in the frame, the loop continues to the next frame.\n",
        "    * **Face Encoding:** For each detected face location, it extracts facial features (encodings) using `face_recognition.face_encodings`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Face Matching and Analysis:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*  **Matching with Known Faces:** If there are known face encodings (`encodeDictKnown`), it iterates through each detected face and its encoding:\n",
        "    * **Face Distance Calculation:** It calculates the \"face distance\" between the current face encoding and all known encodings using `face_recognition.face_distance`. This distance represents the similarity between faces.\n",
        "    * **Matching Threshold:** It finds the minimum distance (closest match) and compares it to a threshold (0.60 in this case). If the distance is lower than the threshold, it considers it a match.\n",
        "    * **Matched Name Retrieval:** If a match is found, it retrieves the name associated with the closest known encoding.\n",
        "*  **New Face Detection:**\n",
        "    * **No Match:** If no match is found, it signifies a new face. It creates a unique name for the person (e.g., \"person_X\") and adds the new face encoding to the `encodeDictKnown` dictionary.\n",
        "    * **Updating Counters:** It increments the `unique_faces_count` (total unique faces) and `new_faces_count` (new faces in this video).\n",
        "*  **Tracking Faces in Video:** It adds the detected name (matched or unique) to the `current_video_faces` set to avoid duplicates within the current video. It then appends the name to the `faces_in_video` list.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Saving and Reporting:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*  **Save Encodings:** After processing all frames in the video, it saves the updated `encodeDictKnown` dictionary (including potentially new faces) back to the JSON file.\n",
        "*  **New Faces and Detected People:** It appends the `new_faces_count` and a comma-separated string of detected faces (`faces_in_video`) for the current video to separate lists (`new_faces_detected` and `people_detected`).\n",
        "*  **Video Cleanup:** It releases the video capture resources and deletes the downloaded video file to save space.\n",
        "*  **Reporting:** It prints a message indicating the video has been processed and deleted, along with the total number of unique faces detected in that video.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Updating Excel Data:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Length Check:** The script ensures the lengths of `new_faces_detected` and `people_detected` lists match the number of rows in the DataFrame.\n",
        "* **Adding New Columns:** If the lengths match, it adds two new columns to the DataFrame:\n",
        "    * \"People Detected\": This column stores the comma-separated list of faces detected in each video (from `people_detected`).\n",
        "    * \"Number of New Faces Detected\": This column stores the count of new faces detected in each video (from `new_faces_detected`).\n",
        "* **Mismatch Handling:** If the lengths don't match, it prints an error message indicating an issue during face detection.\n",
        "* **Save Updated Excel:** Finally, it creates a new Excel file with the updated data (`output_excel_file`) using the pandas `to_excel` method.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Additional Notes:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* The script utilizes a pre-trained CNN model (\"cnn\") for face detection. This model is likely part of the `face_recognition` library.\n",
        "* The threshold value (0.60) for considering a face a match can be adjusted based on the desired accuracy and application.\n",
        "* The script demonstrates a basic implementation of face recognition with known encodings stored in a JSON file. More advanced approaches might involve database storage and retrieval of encodings.\n",

        "It seems like you've summarized the performance statistics for influencers based on their appearances in the dataset. Here’s how you can interpret and proceed with this data:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Metrics:\n",
        "1. **Mean Performance:** Represents the average engagement generated by the influencer.\n",
        "2. **Median Performance:** Indicates the middle point of performance and is useful for understanding central tendency, especially if there are outliers.\n",
        "3. **Standard Deviation (Std_Deviation):** Reflects the consistency of the influencer's performance. Lower values suggest consistent engagement.\n",
        "4. **Appearances:** Shows the number of times the influencer appears in the dataset, which can help gauge reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Suggestions to Choose Influencers:\n",
        "1. **Consistency and High Average Performance:**\n",
        "   - Look for influencers with high **Mean Performance** and low **Std_Deviation.**\n",
        "   - Example: `person_42` (Mean Performance: 1.09, Std_Deviation: 0.46) and `person_24` (Mean Performance: 1.13, Std_Deviation: 0.44).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Sufficient Appearances:**\n",
        "   - Avoid influencers with very few appearances as their performance metrics may not be reliable.\n",
        "   - Example: Focus on influencers with at least 10 appearances, such as `person_1` (89 appearances) or `person_2` (90 appearances).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Balanced Strategy:**\n",
        "   - Combine influencers with high performance and those who are consistent across campaigns for a balanced approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Actionable Steps:\n",
        "1. **Rank Influencers:**\n",
        "   - Create a ranking by weighting the metrics (e.g., Mean Performance contributes 50%, Median 30%, and Std_Deviation consistency 20%).\n",
        "   - Normalize values for proper comparison.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Visualize Results:**\n",
        "   - Plot influencers’ Mean Performance against Std_Deviation for easy identification of high-performing, consistent influencers.\n",
        "   - Use a bubble chart to include **Appearances** as bubble size.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Filter Low Performers:**\n",
        "   - Exclude influencers with Mean Performance below a threshold (e.g., 0.7) or Std_Deviation above a threshold (e.g., 0.7).\n",
